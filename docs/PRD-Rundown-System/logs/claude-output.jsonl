Success Criteria\n\n### Phase A Complete When:\n- [ ] Producer can click \"Load Rundown\" and segments appear in Producer View\n- [ ] \"Start Show\" begins execution with loaded segments\n- [ ] Segment progression works (auto-advance and manual)\n- [ ] OBS scene switching works when segment changes\n- [ ] Graphics fire when segment has a graphic configured\n- [ ] Changes in Rundown Editor can be re-loaded\n- [ ] Two competitions can run independently without interference\n\n### Phase H Complete When:\n- [ ] Rehearsal mode runs full show without firing OBS/graphics\n- [ ] \"REHEARSAL\" indicator visible in all views\n- [ ] Timing proceeds normally for practice\n\n### Phase B Complete When:\n- [ ] Talent View accessible at `/{compId}/talent`\n- [ ] Shows current segment with prominent time remaining\n- [ ] Scene switching buttons work\n- [ ] Notes visible to talent\n\n### Phase I Complete When:\n- [ ] Producer sees \"Rundown Modified\" warning badge when rundown changes during show\n- [ ] \"Reload Rundown\" updates segments without losing current position\n- [ ] Confirmation dialog shows summary of changes (added/removed/modified segments)\n- [ ] Deleted current segment is handled gracefully (stay on it, warn producer)\n- [ ] Past segments (already completed) are not affected by reload\n\n### Phase J Complete When:\n- [ ] Actual segment durations logged during show\n- [ ] Historical timing data available in Rundown Editor\n\n---\n\n## 6. Terminology\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|------------|\n| **Segment** | A unit of show content (e.g., \"UCLA Introduction\", \"Rotation 1 Start\") |\n| **Rundown** | The complete list of segments for a show |\n| **Rundown Editor** | UI for creating/editing segments (`/{compId}/rundown`) |\n| **Timesheet Engine** | Server-side code that executes the show |\n| **Producer View** | Full production control page (`/{compId}/producer`) |\n| **Talent View** | Simplified commentator interface (`/{compId}/talent`) |\n| **Hold Segment** | A segment that waits for manual advance |\n| **Coordinator** | Central server managing all competitions |\n| **Competition VM** | EC2 instance assigned to a competition (runs OBS) |\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":68,"oldLines":7,"newStart":68,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," | Task | Description | Status | Notes |"," |------|-------------|--------|-------|","-| Task 1 | Update TimesheetEngine constructor to accept `compId` and `obsConnectionManager` | NOT STARTED | |","+| Task 1 | Update TimesheetEngine constructor to accept `compId` and `obsConnectionManager` | COMPLETE | Commit 9d0267c |"," | Task 2 | Create `timesheetEngines` Map in server/index.js | NOT STARTED | |"," | Task 3 | Update `_applyTransitionAndSwitchScene()` to use `obsConnectionManager.getConnection(this.compId)` | NOT STARTED | |"," | Task 4 | Update `_playVideo()` to use per-competition OBS connection | NOT STARTED | |"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

**Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":191,"oldLines":7,"newStart":191,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### Task 1: Update TimesheetEngine constructor"," ","-**Status:** NOT STARTED","+**Status:** COMPLETE (Commit 9d0267c)"," **File:** `server/lib/timesheetEngine.js`"," "," **Description:**"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed.

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed.

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":64,"oldLines":7,"newStart":64,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## Task Summary by Phase"," ","-### Phase A: Connect Editor to Engine (P0) - NOT STARTED","+### Phase A: Connect Editor to Engine (P0) - IN PROGRESS (2/16 complete)"," "," | Task | Description | Status | Notes |"," |------|-------------|--------|-------|"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

There's no bridge between planning and execution, and the engine doesn't support multiple simultaneous competitions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Goals\n\n| Goal | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Connect Planning to Execution** | Load saved rundowns into the execution engine |\n| **Multi-Competition Support** | Run multiple shows independently on different VMs |\n| **Talent Support** | Simplified view for commentators |\n| **Rehearsal Capability** | Dry-run shows without firing real graphics/OBS |\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","numLines":485,"startLine":1,"totalLines":485}}}

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed.

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

graphicsRegistry.js.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Check current implementation of graphics picker\n- [ ] Verify graphicsRegistry.js is imported and used\n- [ ] Confirm graphics filtered by competition type\n\n---\n\n### Task 16: Fix hardcoded picker data\n\n**Status:** NOT STARTED\n**File:** `show-controller/src/pages/RundownEditorPage.jsx`\n\n**Description:**\nReplace any hardcoded picker data with live data sources.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Replace DUMMY_SCENES with OBS scene list (if hardcoded)\n- [ ] Verify graphics come from registry\n- [ ] Test with actual competition data\n\n---\n\n## Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":232,"oldLines":17,"newStart":232,"newLines":22,"lines":[" "," ### Task 3: Update _applyTransitionAndSwitchScene()"," ","-**Status:** NOT STARTED","+**Status:** COMPLETE"," **File:** `server/lib/timesheetEngine.js`"," "," **Description:**"," Update the scene switching method to use per-competition OBS connection via obsConnectionManager."," "," **Checklist:**","-- [ ] Replace `this.obs.call(...)` with `this.obsConnectionManager.getConnection(this.compId).call(...)`","-- [ ] Handle case when connection doesn't exist","-- [ ] Add error handling for disconnected state","+- [x] Replace `this.obs.call(...)` with `this.obsConnectionManager.getConnection(this.compId).call(...)`","+- [x] Handle case when connection doesn't exist","+- [x] Add error handling for disconnected state"," ","+**Implementation Notes:**","+- Updated method to first check for `obsConnectionManager` + `compId` (preferred)","+- Added fallback to legacy `this.obs` for backward compatibility","+- Emits error event with `type: 'obs_scene_switch'` when no connection found for competition","+"," ---"," "," ### Task 4: Update _playVideo()"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Show continues through all segments\n\n**Status:** ⚠️ Engine logic exists, but can't load segments\n\n---\n\n### Story 4: Multiple Competitions Run Independently\n\n**As a** Production company running two meets simultaneously\n**I want** each competition to have independent show control\n**So that** one show doesn't interfere with the other\n\n**Scenario:**\n- Competition A: UCLA vs Oregon on VM 50.19.137.152\n- Competition B: Stanford vs Cal on VM 54.210.98.89\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Each producer sees only their competition's segments\n- OBS commands route to the correct VM\n- No interference between shows\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented (single global engine)\n\n---\n\n### Story 5: Producer Reloads Modified Rundown (Pre-Show)\n\n**As a** Producer who made last-minute changes before starting\n**I want to** reload the rundown after editing\n**So that** I can incorporate changes before the show begins\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Show is loaded but not started\n2. Open Rundown Editor in new tab, make changes, save\n3. Return to Producer View\n4. Click \"Reload Rundown\"\n5. Updated segments appear\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented\n\n---\n\n### Story 6: Producer Runs Rehearsal\n\n**As a** Producer preparing for a show\n**I want to** run through the show without firing real graphics or OBS\n**So that** I can verify timing and flow before going live\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Load rundown\n2. Enable \"Rehearsal Mode\"\n3. Start show - segments progress with timing\n4. OBS and graphics do NOT fire\n5. \"REHEARSAL\" indicator visible throughout\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented\n\n---\n\n### Story 7: Talent Views Their Segments\n\n**As a** Commentator\n**I want** a simplified view showing my current segment and time remaining\n**So that** I can pace my commentary appropriately\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Navigate to `/{compId}/talent`\n2. See current segment with large countdown timer\n3. See notes for current segment\n4. See preview of next segment\n5. Quick scene-switch buttons available\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented\n\n---\n\n### Story 8: Producer Modifies Rundown During Live Show\n\n**As a** Producer running a live broadcast\n**I want to** add, remove, or modify upcoming segments mid-show\n**So that** I can adapt to unexpected situations (injury, schedule change, breaking news)\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Show is running, currently on segment 12 of 24\n2. Producer opens Rundown Editor in a new tab\n3. Adds a new segment between 15 and 16 (e.g., \"Breaking: Injury Update\")\n4. Saves changes\n5. Returns to Producer View\n6. Sees \"Rundown Modified\" warning badge\n7. Clicks \"Reload Rundown\"\n8. Confirmation dialog: \"Reload will add 1 segment. Current position preserved.\"\n9. Confirms → segment list updates, show continues from current position\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Current segment was deleted → Stay on it until manual advance, warn producer\n- Segments before current were reordered → Ignore past segments, preserve position\n- Multiple producers editing simultaneously → Last-write-wins with conflict warning\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented (Phase I)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Phase Overview\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Goal |\n|-------|------|----------|------|\n| **A** | Connect Editor to Engine | P0 | Load rundown, execute show, multi-competition support |\n| **H** | Rehearsal Mode | P1 | Dry-run without firing OBS/graphics |\n| **B** | Talent View | P1 | Simplified commentator interface |\n| **I** | Live Rundown Sync | P2 | Hot-reload changes during show |\n| **J** | Timing Analytics | P2 | Track actual vs planned duration |\n| **D** | AI Suggestions (Planning) | P2 | Suggest segments based on competition context |\n| **E** | Script & Talent Flow | P2 | Pipe scripts to Talent View |\n| **C** | AI Context (Live) | P3 | Real-time talking points during show |\n| **F** | Audio Cue Integration | P3 | Trigger audio from segments |\n| **G** | Production Tracking | P3 | Equipment and sponsor reports |\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Editor segment format to Timesheet Engine format.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Create `server/lib/segmentMapper.js`\n- [ ] Map `scene` → `obsScene`\n- [ ] Map `graphic.graphicId` → `graphic`\n- [ ] Map `graphic.params` → `graphicData`\n- [ ] Map `timingMode` → `autoAdvance` (fixed=true, manual=false)\n- [ ] Preserve all other fields\n\n---\n\n### Task 12: Verify Firebase passed to engine\n\n**Status:** NOT STARTED\n**File:** `server/index.js`\n\n**Description:**\nVerify Firebase Admin is correctly passed and usable in engine.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Add logging to confirm Firebase instance received\n- [ ] Test that `_triggerGraphic()` can write to Firebase\n- [ ] Handle missing Firebase gracefully\n\n---\n\n### Task 13: Show rundown status indicator\n\n**Status:** NOT STARTED\n**File:** `show-controller/src/views/ProducerView.jsx`\n\n**Description:**\nAdd status indicator showing rundown state (idle, loaded, modified).\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Add status badge component\n- [ ] Show \"No Rundown\" when state is IDLE\n- [ ] Show \"Rundown Loaded\" when state is LOADED\n- [ ] Show segment count in badge\n\n---\n\n### Task 14: Verify scene picker uses OBS state\n\n**Status:** NOT STARTED\n**File:** `show-controller/src/pages/RundownEditorPage.jsx`\n\n**Description:**\nVerify that the scene picker dropdown loads scenes from OBS connection state rather than hardcoded data.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Check current implementation of scene picker\n- [ ] If hardcoded, plan integration with OBS scene list\n- [ ] Document current state\n\n---\n\n### Task 15: Verify graphics picker uses Registry\n\n**Status:** NOT STARTED\n**File:** `show-controller/src/pages/RundownEditorPage.jsx`\n\n**Description:**\nVerify that the graphics picker dropdown uses graphicsRegistry.js.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Check current implementation of graphics picker\n- [ ] Verify graphicsRegistry.js is imported and used\n- [ ] Confirm graphics filtered by competition type\n\n---\n\n### Task 16: Fix hardcoded picker data\n\n**Status:** NOT STARTED\n**File:** `show-controller/src/pages/RundownEditorPage.jsx`\n\n**Description:**\nReplace any hardcoded picker data with live data sources.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Replace DUMMY_SCENES with OBS scene list (if hardcoded)\n- [ ] Verify graphics come from registry\n- [ ] Test with actual competition data\n\n---\n\n## Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","numLines":490,"startLine":1,"totalLines":490}}}

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed.

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed.

Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":252,"oldLines":16,"newStart":252,"newLines":22,"lines":[" "," ### Task 4: Update _playVideo()"," ","-**Status:** NOT STARTED","+**Status:** COMPLETE"," **File:** `server/lib/timesheetEngine.js`"," "," **Description:**"," Update the video playback method to use per-competition OBS connection."," "," **Checklist:**","-- [ ] Replace `this.obs.call(...)` with `this.obsConnectionManager.getConnection(this.compId).call(...)`","-- [ ] Handle case when connection doesn't exist","+- [x] Replace `this.obs.call(...)` with `this.obsConnectionManager.getConnection(this.compId).call(...)`","+- [x] Handle case when connection doesn't exist"," ","+**Implementation Notes:**","+- Updated `_playVideo()` to first check for `obsConnectionManager` + `compId` (preferred)","+- Added fallback to legacy `this.obs` for backward compatibility","+- Emits error event with `type: 'obs_video'` when no connection found for competition","+- Also updated `_handleSegmentTypeActions()` to remove redundant `this.obs` check since `_playVideo()` now handles its own connection checking","+"," ---"," "," ### Task 5: Update _applyAudioOverrides()"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Problem Statement\n\nThe production system has two disconnected pieces:\n\n1. **Rundown Editor** - UI for planning show segments (exists, works)\n2. **Timesheet Engine** - Server-side show execution (code exists, not wired)\n\nProducers can create rundowns but cannot execute them. There's no bridge between planning and execution, and the engine doesn't support multiple simultaneous competitions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Goals\n\n| Goal | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Connect Planning to Execution** | Load saved rundowns into the execution engine |\n| **Multi-Competition Support** | Run multiple shows independently on different VMs |\n| **Talent Support** | Simplified view for commentators |\n| **Rehearsal Capability** | Dry-run shows without firing real graphics/OBS |\n\n---\n\n## 3. User Stories\n\n### Story 1: Producer Creates a Rundown\n\n**As a** Producer planning a UCLA vs Oregon meet\n**I want to** create segments in the Rundown Editor\n**So that** I have a structured plan for the show\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Navigate to `/{compId}/rundown`\n2. Add segments (Pre-Show Graphics, Welcome, Team Introductions, etc.)\n3. Assign scenes, graphics, timing to each segment\n4. Click Save\n5. Segments saved to Firebase\n\n**Status:** ✅ Works today\n\n---\n\n### Story 2: Producer Loads Rundown for Execution\n\n**As a** Producer ready to run the show\n**I want to** load my saved rundown into the execution engine\n**So that** I can start the show with all my segments ready\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Navigate to `/{compId}/producer` (Producer View)\n2. See \"No rundown loaded\" indicator\n3. Click \"Load Rundown\" button\n4. Segments appear in the \"Show Progress\" panel\n5. See \"Rundown loaded: 24 segments\" confirmation\n6. \"Start Show\" button becomes active\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented\n\n---\n\n### Story 3: Producer Runs the Show\n\n**As a** Producer executing a live broadcast\n**I want** segments to progress automatically or manually\n**So that** the show flows smoothly with proper timing\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Click \"Start Show\"\n2. First segment activates:\n   - Timer counts down\n   - OBS switches to assigned scene\n   - Graphics fire if configured\n   - Progress bar shows completion\n3. Auto-advance segments progress automatically\n4. Manual segments wait for producer to click \"Next\"\n5. Show continues through all segments\n\n**Status:** ⚠️ Engine logic exists, but can't load segments\n\n---\n\n### Story 4: Multiple Competitions Run Independently\n\n**As a** Production company running two meets simultaneously\n**I want** each competition to have independent show control\n**So that** one show doesn't interfere with the other\n\n**Scenario:**\n- Competition A: UCLA vs Oregon on VM 50.19.137.152\n- Competition B: Stanford vs Cal on VM 54.210.98.89\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Each producer sees only their competition's segments\n- OBS commands route to the correct VM\n- No interference between shows\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented (single global engine)\n\n---\n\n### Story 5: Producer Reloads Modified Rundown (Pre-Show)\n\n**As a** Producer who made last-minute changes before starting\n**I want to** reload the rundown after editing\n**So that** I can incorporate changes before the show begins\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Show is loaded but not started\n2. Open Rundown Editor in new tab, make changes, save\n3. Return to Producer View\n4. Click \"Reload Rundown\"\n5. Updated segments appear\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented\n\n---\n\n### Story 6: Producer Runs Rehearsal\n\n**As a** Producer preparing for a show\n**I want to** run through the show without firing real graphics or OBS\n**So that** I can verify timing and flow before going live\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Load rundown\n2. Enable \"Rehearsal Mode\"\n3. Start show - segments progress with timing\n4. OBS and graphics do NOT fire\n5. \"REHEARSAL\" indicator visible throughout\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented\n\n---\n\n### Story 7: Talent Views Their Segments\n\n**As a** Commentator\n**I want** a simplified view showing my current segment and time remaining\n**So that** I can pace my commentary appropriately\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Navigate to `/{compId}/talent`\n2. See current segment with large countdown timer\n3. See notes for current segment\n4. See preview of next segment\n5. Quick scene-switch buttons available\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented\n\n---\n\n### Story 8: Producer Modifies Rundown During Live Show\n\n**As a** Producer running a live broadcast\n**I want to** add, remove, or modify upcoming segments mid-show\n**So that** I can adapt to unexpected situations (injury, schedule change, breaking news)\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Show is running, currently on segment 12 of 24\n2. Producer opens Rundown Editor in a new tab\n3. Adds a new segment between 15 and 16 (e.g., \"Breaking: Injury Update\")\n4. Saves changes\n5. Returns to Producer View\n6. Sees \"Rundown Modified\" warning badge\n7. Clicks \"Reload Rundown\"\n8. Confirmation dialog: \"Reload will add 1 segment. Current position preserved.\"\n9. Confirms → segment list updates, show continues from current position\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Current segment was deleted → Stay on it until manual advance, warn producer\n- Segments before current were reordered → Ignore past segments, preserve position\n- Multiple producers editing simultaneously → Last-write-wins with conflict warning\n\n**Status:** ❌ Not implemented (Phase I)\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","numLines":496,"startLine":1,"totalLines":496}}}

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":72,"oldLines":7,"newStart":72,"newLines":7,"lines":[" | Task 2 | Create `timesheetEngines` Map in server/index.js | COMPLETE | Added Map, getOrCreateEngine, getEngine, removeEngine functions |"," | Task 3 | Update `_applyTransitionAndSwitchScene()` to use `obsConnectionManager.getConnection(this.compId)` | COMPLETE | Updated to get OBS connection from obsConnectionManager using compId, with fallback to legacy this.obs |"," | Task 4 | Update `_playVideo()` to use per-competition OBS connection | COMPLETE | Updated to use obsConnectionManager.getConnection(compId) with fallback to legacy this.obs |","-| Task 5 | Update `_applyAudioOverrides()` to use per-competition OBS connection | NOT STARTED | |","+| Task 5 | Update `_applyAudioOverrides()` to use per-competition OBS connection | COMPLETE | Updated to use obsConnectionManager.getConnection(compId) with fallback to legacy this.obs |"," | Task 6 | Update all socket event broadcasts to target competition room | NOT STARTED | |"," | Task 7 | Pass Firebase Admin instance to engine for `_triggerGraphic()` | NOT STARTED | |"," | Task 8 | Add `loadRundown` socket handler on server | NOT STARTED | |"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Phase A connects the existing Rundown Editor to the Timesheet Engine for live show execution. Subsequent phases add rehearsal mode, talent view, live sync, analytics, and AI features.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PRD-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Product requirements |\n| [PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) | Technical reference (architecture, state machine, socket events, error handling, testing) |\n\n---\n\n## IMPORTANT: Task Execution Rules\n\n**ONE TASK = ONE ITERATION**\n\nEach row in the task tables below is ONE task. Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":64,"oldLines":7,"newStart":64,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## Task Summary by Phase"," ","-### Phase A: Connect Editor to Engine (P0) - IN PROGRESS (4/16 complete)","+### Phase A: Connect Editor to Engine (P0) - IN PROGRESS (5/16 complete)"," "," | Task | Description | Status | Notes |"," |------|-------------|--------|-------|"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Complete exactly ONE task per iteration:\n\n1. Pick the first NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS task\n2. Implement that ONE task\n3. Commit, deploy, verify\n4. STOP - the next iteration will handle the next task\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Complete multiple tasks in one iteration\n- Batch \"related\" tasks together\n- Complete an entire phase in one iteration\n\n**Task Numbering:**\n- Tasks are numbered sequentially: Task 1, Task 2, ... Task 71\n- Each task number is unique and independent\n- Example: \"Task 8\" is ONE task, not a subtask\n\n---\n\n## Phase Summary\n\n| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Tasks

multi-competition support.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [ ] Add `compId` parameter to constructor\n- [ ] Add `obsConnectionManager` parameter to constructor\n- [ ] Store both as instance properties\n- [ ] Remove dependency on global `obs` singleton\n\n---\n\n### Task 2: Create timesheetEngines Map\n\n**Status:** COMPLETE\n**File:** `server/index.js`\n\n**Description:**\nCreate a Map to store per-competition TimesheetEngine instances, replacing the single global instance.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- [x] Replace `let timesheetEngine` with `const timesheetEngines = new Map()`\n- [x] Create `getOrCreateEngine(compId, obsConnectionManager, firebase, io)` function\n- [x] Update existing engine initialization logic\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- Added `const timesheetEngines = new Map()` to store per-competition engines\n- Kept legacy `let timesheetEngine = null` for backward compatibility during transition\n- Created `getOrCreateEngine(compId, obsConnectionManager, firebase, io)` function that:\n  - Creates new engine with compId, obsConnectionManager, firebase, and io\n  - Wires up all events to broadcast to competition-specific room (`competition:${compId}`)\n  - Stores engine in the Map for reuse\n- Created `getEngine(compId)` helper to retrieve existing engines\n- Created `removeEngine(compId)` helper to clean up engines when competitions end\n\n---\n\n### Task 3:

Bugs & Issues\n\n| Bug ID | Description | Status | Task |\n|--------|-------------|--------|------|\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dependencies\n- **Phase A** is the prerequisite for all other phases\n- **Phase H** and **Phase B** can run in parallel after Phase A\n- **Phase I-G** depend on Phase A completion\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n- Multi-competition support requires Map-based engine instances\n- Socket.io rooms isolate competition events\n- Firebase Admin must be passed to engine (not just client SDK)\n- OBS connections managed by existing obsConnectionManager\n\n### Critical Gap Identified\nCurrent `server/index.js` uses single global `timesheetEngine` instance. Must refactor to per-competition Map before any Phase A work can proceed. See [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 5.2 for details.\n\n### Key Files Reference\nSee [Technical Reference](./PLAN-Rundown-System-2026-01-23.md) Section 4 for complete file listing.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n**Phase A Complete:** Producer can load rundown from Firebase, start show, and see segments execute with OBS scene changes.\n\n**MVP Complete:** Phases A + H + B (producer can run rehearsals, talent has dedicated view).\n\n**Full System:** All phases complete.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":272,"oldLines":16,"newStart":272,"newLines":22,"lines":[" "," ### Task 5: Update _applyAudioOverrides()"," ","-**Status:** NOT STARTED","+**Status:** COMPLETE"," **File:** `server/lib/timesheetEngine.js`"," "," **Description:**"," Update the audio override method to use per-competition OBS connection."," "," **Checklist:**","-- [ ] Replace `this.obs.call(...)` with `this.obsConnectionManager.getConnection(this.compId).call(...)`","-- [ ] Handle case when connection doesn't exist","+- [x] Replace `this.obs.call(...)` with `this.obsConnectionManager.getConnection(this.compId).call(...)`","+- [x] Handle case when connection doesn't exist"," ","+**Implementation Notes:**","+- Updated `_applyAudioOverrides()` to first check for `obsConnectionManager` + `compId` (preferred)","+- Added fallback to legacy `this.obs` for backward compatibility","+- Emits error event with `type: 'obs_audio'` when no connection found for competition","+- Follows same pattern as `_applyTransitionAndSwitchScene()` and `_playVideo()`","+"," ---"," "," ### Task 6: Update socket event broadcasts"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}
