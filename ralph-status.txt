Analyzing source module and test patterns
Running tests to verify implementation
Done: Created obsSourceManager tests - 40 tests passing
Starting: OBS-14 Deploy and Verify
Step 2 complete: All endpoints verified
Step 3 complete: Server packaged
Step 4 complete: Uploaded to coordinator
Step 5: Files extracted, restarting PM2
