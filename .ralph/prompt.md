# Phase 0 - Review
- read .ralph/TASKS.md to understand current state

# Phase 1 - Implementation
- pick the SINGLE highest priority incomplete [ ] item from .ralph/TASKS.md
- implement it fully

# Phase 2 - Validation
- ensure the code works (run tests/build if applicable)

# Phase 3 - Document & Commit
- update .ralph/TASKS.md to mark the item [x] complete
- move it to Completed Tasks section
- git add -A && git commit -m 'descriptive message'

# Rules
- if stuck on an item after 3 attempts, mark it BLOCKED and move on
- keep changes focused and atomic
