STEP 4: Network Connectivity
✗ Port 4455 is NOT accessible from coordinator to VM
✗ AWS Security Group does NOT allow inbound traffic on port 4455

ROOT CAUSE:
The AWS security group (sg-025f1ac53cccb756b "gymnastics-vm-pool") does not have an inbound rule for port 4455 (OBS WebSocket).

BLOCKING ISSUE:
Cannot complete integration test without opening port 4455 in security group.
User declined to grant permission for aws_open_port tool.

CURRENT STATUS: BLOCKED

To unblock, manually run:
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-025f1ac53cccb756b \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 4455 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0 \
  --description "OBS WebSocket for coordinator integration"

Then restart coordinator to establish connection.
Starting: Open port 4455 for OBS WebSocket
